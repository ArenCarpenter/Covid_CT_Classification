# Covid_CT_Classification

## WORK IN PROGRESS

#### Aren Carpenter

Submission for Grand Challenge's "CT Diagnosis of Covid-19" challenge. It is a binary classification problem for determining the presence of Covid-19 solely from CT scans of patients. 

The data can be found on the submission's GitHub page: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT, and the challenge entry is here: https://covid-ct.grand-challenge.org/CT-diagnosis-of-COVID-19/.

## Introduction & Social Case

Few outbreaks in modern history have had as large of a public health and economic effect as Covid-19. While a vaccine is still in progress, physicians need cheap and effective techniques for identifying Covid-19 positive patients. 

## Data and EDA

The images are collected from COVID19-related papers from medRxiv, bioRxiv, NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, etc. CTs containing COVID-19 abnormalities are selected by reading the figure captions in the papers.
